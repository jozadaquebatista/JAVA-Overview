// This is our first JAVA program. Did simple, for easy understanding.


/*
*
*
* First Notation: Note this program print a message on the screen,
*                 and it is formed with only a main Class, that means,
*                 it is just a class with a main method in it, it scare me
*                 a lot, I'm laughing very much. xD
*
*                 Note that the can have another class on it, and works totally
*                 different from a custom main in C++.
